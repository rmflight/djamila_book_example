# Welcome to SYMBIOSIS!

This is a book about colonization, and our languages within it.

If you are new, you will want to start [at the beginning]({{<ref "outro.md" >}}).

Alternatively, check the sidebar, or the [chapters](chapters) listing.

For more about me, where I come from, and my other writing projects, see the main site.
