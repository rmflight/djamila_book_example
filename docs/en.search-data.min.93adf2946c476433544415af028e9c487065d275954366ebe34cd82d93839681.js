If anyone bothers to ask, we can tell another.”\nThis Ks’ou, who should have been his enemy, said these words as she shifted her weight on the edge of the vault of their damaged ship, then pushed one of the last bottles of water in his direction. It rolled to him easily. He picked it up and tried to suppress the hint of disgust as he drank, but he could not help the display, obvious as a Human grimace. To make this moment worse, the breeze was not so kind as to be cool; still, it was night, and so, between the dust above and the sand below they heaved a collective, if not somewhat forced, sigh of relief from the onslaught that mid-day wrought.\nHe brushed off the feeling of dis-ease: he wasn’t really sharing water with a Ksou.\nShe’ll be dead soon. This didn’t count.\nHer chosen name was Aurana. She wasn’t looking at him, but was instead intensely staring at the old device she held in her hand, small enough to fit in the palm of it. Clunky as it was, he was grateful—it brought them music of the Human kind. For Efyir, this sound was hard to like, but by now Aurana had figured out what he preferred and what he despised. She was far less picky. How they negotiated with one another was often over which song they could agree to listen to together.\nHis father named him Efyir-Azayim, but he had pushed thoughts of his father far from his mind in this moment. He was watching closely to her hand movements on the device. He was trying, politely, not to look at her neck, and failing. Even in the moonlight, the pulses at the top of her exposed neck were unmistakeable. She ignored his gaze and after awhile, began:\n“Promise me…”\n“I’ve made enough false promises between us,” Efyir said abruptly.\nBut Aurana smiled. “Promise me you’ll tell your father. That we ruined the title of his book.”\nImpossible Discourse. Well, it was a start. Not a perfect one.\nShe was again clicking the device, until it finally landed on a song that she knew would please both of them. The earphones were the kind that you stuck in your ear. The one he held fit ill in his Thhiyatkhoor earlobe, but at the right angle the rich sound filed out of the instrument and into his mind. The sound they shared: the other earbud stretched out and was inserted in the ear of a human. Not just a human: a human occupied by a Ks’ou.\nHe tried not to think about that.\nThe song ended. The intentional clicks of the device sounded again as she frantically searched for another song that would be agreeable to them both. He very obviously closed the top of the bottle and rolled it back to her, which she caught without looking up but did not bring to her lips.\n“I’m sorry you will die.” He finally said it. He’d wanted to say it all day. The clicks stopped for only a moment, and then continued again, as if motivated by a frantic compulsion.\n“Don’t be ridiculous. When has a Thhiyatkhoor ever been sorry over a Ks’ou death?” As if to answer her own question, she took a quick sip of water, closed the top and rolled it back to him.\nShe was right. He corrected: “I’m sorry that my actions lead to your untimely death… I still have to truth-tell, per our custom. This is a final battle.”\n“The battle is over. I failed.”\n“The battle isn’t over. It’s shifted.” He wasn’t feeling very argumentative—it seemed to issue naturally whenever he was around her. “It is now towards the life of your human, who will remain after you die tomorrow. And my own life. So I truth-tell… I would like to think the General will be pleased to be corrected on a point that was his life’s work. So, yes, I will tell him. Perhaps he will be compelled to change his title.” That last point was an embellishment. Knowing his father, he wouldn’t.\nShe smiled thinly, still unsatisfied.\n“So promise me…” she spoke, hoping to push him, further. Relentless. Exhausting. Intriguing. “That you’ll tell him how powerful our resistance is? That he won’t need to send a fleet?”\nEfyir could make no such promise. It wasn’t even certain that he would survive this to deliver the message. But he could say, “The General knows the dangers of this. He is fond of humans, against Thhiyatkhoor custom. He will want to protect them as best as possible.”\n“El.” He cringed. The nickname she’d given him once meant more than it did now. She had put the device down so that there was no sound between them, except the rustling of emptiness throughout the sand dunes. “Are we allies?”\nThe branches on his head stretched out into the darkness. They could reach out, like wisps of thread, and feel the air far around them. He could feel the emptiness of plenitude they were compressed between: billions of tiny holes in the sky and billions of rocks below them under the ship, still radiant with the day’s heat.\n“First encounters can never be replicated, and ours was built on the absence of truth. You didn’t tell me what you were. And I didn’t tell you my name.” A burst of sound interrupted. She’d found the song, although he suspected she was compromising, because there were elements he knew she didn’t like. He talked through it. “But sleep is no longer relevant. So… we have a few hours left to try.” He turned to her so that he was looking at the human, directly, and could no longer see the back of her neck where Aurana pulsed discreetly. “If Ana promises me something.”\n“What is that?”\n“That she’ll finish your book. A Brief History of Human Colonization. Even when you die.” This place was miserable. It was still too hot; he could see it on her face. There would be no more arguing. No more sparring, either.\nAurana nodded, then gulped, as if gasping for air. It would be time, soon. There was not enough water for them both. Soon, not enough for any of them. He had forgotten to take a sip, and hoped she hadn’t noticed, either. He pushed the water back in her direction but she stopped it mid-roll, and did not move to lift if to her human’s lips. He did not urge her to drink from it, despite a strange compulsion in him to say so. It wasn’t right. It wasn’t his place.\nThe texts labeled ‘history’ would tell one story—that was certain. His father had learned this lesson the hard way. If only her human could finish the book. Perhaps they could tell another.\n Next Chapter\n"});index.add({'id':1,'href':'/symbiosisnovel/chapters/chapter-1/','title':"Chapter 1 (Kelisfton)",'content':"Chapter 1 (Kelisfton) #   “Flesh describes an alien entity, a more or less expendable figure…\nits most poignant determination is the extent to which such a body cannot prevent or ward off another\u0026rsquo;s touch. The single-most powerful evidence of the loss of freedom is the fact that bodies lose their integrity and may be \u0026gt;invaded or entered… by coercive power. This touch that we associate with intimacy… becomes instead the power to wound and violate.”\n Hortense Spillers1\n Previous Chapter\nThey were beautiful; I would destroy them.\nThe planet of the newly discovered creatures, the Olyat-Koi, appeared in the screen before me and my team of warrior-Settlers. It was small, with only one continent visible from the exosphere where we lay in wait, and these aliens as I had come to understand them seemed placable enough. Trained in intercepting and decoding messages, I happened upon a Thhiyatkhoor transmission which had given these coordinates. Under the guise to my superiors that I was making a simple investigation, a curiosity about a planet I heard about by rumor, I set a course for the Olyat-Koi homeworld. I didn’t want any nosy overseers following and trying to take over what was rightfully my discovery.\nIf the Thhiyatkhoor were here, they would be so peacefully, as the messages had indicated. I wanted to know what they were doing, and if these new creatures were suitable for settling.\nIn the corner, the short, bipedal creature, with tan flesh and a black nest shooting from its head, began to whimper. The creature, a gift from one of my allies and confidantes, was designated to be used for research missions. But a Commander could use research for only one thing.\nThe whimpering grew louder. Why now? I needed to concentrate. “||Quiet that thing||,” I hissed. Not even my own shell of a settled made such noise as this mewling thing had since the transfer had been made to this ship. A soldier, in an elongated body pinched at the waist, raised one of its weapons, but the ensuing clatter into short creature’s skull would not come. I took one immediate leap and slammed the soldier’s head into the wall, pushing so that a trickle of dark blue blood began to emit from its ears: “||I did not say kill it. I need that thing for my project. Are you trying to sabotage me||?”\n“Adê (No),” the soldier whimpered. It sounded as pathetic as the little creature, now, who had quietened and was looking up at us both with widened eyes. I calculated: I could not afford to lose another soldier, nor was it worth losing patience over what amounted to mere vibrations in the air. I released him so he would slide to the floor. To the short thing I said, “||Carry on your irritating and arbitrary noise-making||,” knowing that the stupid thing didn’t understand my language. This would be remedied when I released my current creature and Settled the small one, connecting to its neural pathways as I was biologically designed to do. But not yet.\nAs if on cue it began making noises again. I conceded that if I were as small as it, with so much exposed flesh despite the long sheet of thin fabric covering from just below the head to its lower body, I would perhaps have cause for worry, too. The Ks’ou and it were not much different in that respect—our bodies are vulnerable, unlike the hardened, mosaic bodies of the multitudinously-formed creature I currently possessed, or—I thought this with an inward joy as I turned my attention back to the screen—the Olyat-Koi, whose bodies were as formidable and strong as their minds. The best hosts were sharp in both, as these were rich resources that the Ks’ou could mine for our own purposes. Lost in the thought of finally landing on the planet, executing the plan, and retrieving the exemplar, I was able to push away the sound of the short creature’s bleats as my mind flooded with images of conquest.\nThis would be a day, perhaps, named after me for celebration. I was saving the Olyat-Koi from their illusions of peace. I would bring the galaxy to them, to hold them honorable above all other species.\nIn case you were wondering: there are no heroes in this story. There are those who do heroic acts, and there are moments of courage. Do not consider any of us heroes; we are all only villains until the very moment of our dying breath, until our being is taken into account.\n   Reference lost. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "});index.add({'id':2,'href':'/symbiosisnovel/chapters/','title':"All Chapters",'content':"Chapters #  "});})();
