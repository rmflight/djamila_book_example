    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>“The texts labeled ‘history’ tell one story. If anyone bothers to ask, we can tell another.”</p>
<p>This Ks’ou, who should have been his enemy, said these words as she shifted her weight on the edge of the vault of their damaged ship, then pushed one of the last bottles of water in his direction. It rolled to him easily. He picked it up and tried to suppress the hint of disgust as he drank, but he could not help the display, obvious as a Human grimace. To make this moment worse, the breeze was not so kind as to be cool; still, it was night, and so, between the dust above and the sand below they heaved a collective, if not somewhat forced, sigh of relief from the onslaught that mid-day wrought.</p>
<p>He brushed off the feeling of dis-ease: he wasn’t really sharing water with a Ksou.</p>
<p>She’ll be dead soon. This didn’t count.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Her chosen name was Aurana. She wasn’t looking at him, but was instead intensely staring at the old device she held in her hand, small enough to fit in the palm of it. Clunky as it was, he was grateful—it brought them music of the Human kind. For Efyir, this sound was hard to like, but by now Aurana had figured out what he preferred and what he despised. She was far less picky. How they negotiated with one another was often over which song they could agree to listen to together.</p>
<p>His father named him Efyir-Azayim, but he had pushed thoughts of his father far from his mind in this moment. He was watching closely to her hand movements on the device. He was trying, politely, not to look at her neck, and failing. Even in the moonlight, the pulses at the top of her exposed neck were unmistakeable. She ignored his gaze and after awhile, began:</p>
<p>“Promise me…”</p>
<p>“I’ve made enough false promises between us,” Efyir said abruptly.</p>
<p>But Aurana smiled. “Promise me you’ll tell your father. That we ruined the title of his book.”</p>
<p>Impossible Discourse. Well, it was a start. Not a perfect one.</p>
<p>She was again clicking the device, until it finally landed on a song that she knew would please both of them. The earphones were the kind that you stuck in your ear. The one he held fit ill in his Thhiyatkhoor earlobe, but at the right angle the rich sound filed out of the instrument and into his mind. The sound they shared: the other earbud stretched out and was inserted in the ear of a human. Not just a human: a human occupied by a Ks’ou.</p>
<p>He tried not to think about that.</p>
<p>The song ended. The intentional clicks of the device sounded again as she frantically searched for another song that would be agreeable to them both. He very obviously closed the top of the bottle and rolled it back to her, which she caught without looking up but did not bring to her lips.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry you will die.” He finally said it. He’d wanted to say it all day. The clicks stopped for only a moment, and then continued again, as if motivated by a frantic compulsion.</p>
<p>“Don’t be ridiculous. When has a Thhiyatkhoor ever been sorry over a Ks’ou death?” As if to answer her own question, she took a quick sip of water, closed the top and rolled it back to him.</p>
<p>She was right. He corrected: “I’m sorry that my actions lead to your untimely death… I still have to truth-tell, per our custom. This is a final battle.”</p>
<p>“The battle is over. I failed.”</p>
<p>“The battle isn’t over. It’s shifted.” He wasn’t feeling very argumentative—it seemed to issue naturally whenever he was around her. “It is now towards the life of your human, who will remain after you die tomorrow. And my own life. So I truth-tell… I would like to think the General will be pleased to be corrected on a point that was his life’s work. So, yes, I will tell him. Perhaps he will be compelled to change his title.” That last point was an embellishment. Knowing his father, he wouldn’t.</p>
<p>She smiled thinly, still unsatisfied.</p>
<p>“So promise me…” she spoke, hoping to push him, further. Relentless. Exhausting. Intriguing. “That you’ll tell him how powerful our resistance is? That he won’t need to send a fleet?”</p>
<p>Efyir could make no such promise. It wasn’t even certain that he would survive this to deliver the message. But he could say, “The General knows the dangers of this. He is fond of humans, against Thhiyatkhoor custom. He will want to protect them as best as possible.”</p>
<p>“El.” He cringed. The nickname she’d given him once meant more than it did now. She had put the device down so that there was no sound between them, except the rustling of emptiness throughout the sand dunes. “Are we allies?”</p>
<p>The branches on his head stretched out into the darkness. They could reach out, like wisps of thread, and feel the air far around them. He could feel the emptiness of plenitude they were compressed between: billions of tiny holes in the sky and billions of rocks below them under the ship, still radiant with the day’s heat.</p>
<p>“First encounters can never be replicated, and ours was built on the absence of truth. You didn’t tell me what you were. And I didn’t tell you my name.” A burst of sound interrupted. She’d found the song, although he suspected she was compromising, because there were elements he knew she didn’t like. He talked through it. “But sleep is no longer relevant. So… we have a few hours left to try.” He turned to her so that he was looking at the human, directly, and could no longer see the back of her neck where Aurana pulsed discreetly. “If Ana promises me something.”</p>
<p>“What is that?”<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>“That she’ll finish your book. A Brief History of Human Colonization. Even when you die.” This place was miserable. It was still too hot; he could see it on her face. There would be no more arguing. No more sparring, either.</p>
<p>Aurana nodded, then gulped, as if gasping for air. It would be time, soon. There was not enough water for them both. Soon, not enough for any of them. He had forgotten to take a sip, and hoped she hadn’t noticed, either. He pushed the water back in her direction but she stopped it mid-roll, and did not move to lift if to her human’s lips. He did not urge her to drink from it, despite a strange compulsion in him to say so. It wasn’t right. It wasn’t his place.</p>
<p>The texts labeled ‘history’ would tell one story—that was certain. His father had learned this lesson the hard way. If only her human could finish the book. Perhaps they could tell another.</p>
